  How much do you spend, or more accurately, how much can you spend on where you
  live? The simple rule of thumb is that ideally, you want your rent payment to
  be about 30% of how much you earn monthly. The most you can afford should be
  no more than 45% of what you earn each month.

Trying to determine what you can afford for housing can be one of the most difficult and sobering decisions you will have to make.

How much do you spend, or more accurately, how _much_ can you spend on where you live? The simple rule of thumb is that ideally, you want your rent payment to be about 30% of how much you earn monthly. The most you can afford should be no more than 45% of what you earn each month.

How do you figure that out? If the amount that you earn fluctuates up and down each month based on the number of hours you work or due to income like sales commissions or tips, you absolutely must be conservative about your income assessment. This means that you need to calculate what you can afford based on what would be a bad month for you, because there are going to be times when you will have a bad month. When you have good months, and if you have budgeted rent for bad months, then you may have extra money left over that you can use for entertainment or savings.

**Budget math:**

* \[bad month income\] x 0.30 = minimum rent amount

* \[bad month income\] x 0.45 = maximum rent amount

What do you do if you realize that what you earn isn't going to be enough to afford rent somewhere you like or that is safe? We will discuss that in my next post...
