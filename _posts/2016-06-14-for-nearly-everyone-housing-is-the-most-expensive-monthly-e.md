# "What About Our Roommate Agreement?"

_-Sheldon Cooper (The Big Bang Theory)_

## Understanding Your Housing Options

For nearly everyone, housing is the most expensive monthly expense we have. When moving out for the first time, there are a few options available where housing is concerned.

**Renting an Apartment (or a Home)**

The How of renting is just as important a factor as the Where of renting.

How is the how, you ask?

A landlord or property management company is really only interested in two things; how do they fill a vacant apartment and how can they be sure that if they rent you a vacant apartment, you are going to be able to pay for it each and every month?

Whenever you rent an apartment or house, a landlord is going to run a credit check on you. If you have little or no credit, they may require a co-signer to any lease you sign who, along with you, accepts financial responsibility for paying rent for the duration of the least and any damages to the property that you cause. Typically, for a first-time renter, the co-signer is a roommate or a parent.

Most, but not all of the time, a parent won't co-sign a lease. Personally, I won't sign one for my kid. Not that I hold anything against her. She's a very responsible person. Nonetheless, a lot can happen over a 12 month lease from inability to pay rent for some unforeseen reason to unexpected damage to the apartment. Regardless, the parent would be equally responsible for paying rent or for damages. Most won't want to accept that financial risk for themselves, myself included.

If a co-signer is going to be required, consider having a roommate. A roommate can, of course, minimize the credit risk to a landlord by placing the responsibility for paying on two individuals who both live in the apartment. A roommate also can, obviously, cut your rent cost in half which will, in turn, make it easier for you to pay rent each month.

While a roommate can be great financially, there can be social stresses to consider. Sure, you may get along with the roommate at first, but are you going to be able to work problems out like adults if something goes wrong, or one of you just gets fed up with a pet peeve you just can't take anymore? You're going to have to find a way to make it work. If you can't, and one of you up and moves out, or is unable to pay rent, both of you are still legally responsible for any financial consequences, which can eventually lead you to being taken to court. Definitely not worth the hassle. Living with a roommate is a great way to learn cooperation, patience, and problem solving as long as you _choose your roommate wisely._

If you rent with a roommate or you rent by yourself, you will be required to pay what is frequently referred to as "first month and last month" rent. Typically, this means that if rent is $1000, the deposit is $1000 as well so you would need $2000 to sign the lease contract and move in. Some places just have you pay the first month and a smaller deposit. Therefore, it could be $1000 for the first month rent plus like $400 (for example) for the deposit for a total of $1400\.

In addition to the deposit, there is often an application fee of $25-75\. Yup, they can charge you a fee for the privilege of applying to live on their property.

I don't recommend having a pet. When you move in, you would have to pay an additional pet deposit of typically $150-200 more up front plus about $25-50 extra per month for the pet to live there.Since money is tight, a pet isn't worth the additional cost.

When moving in, as mentioned before, you sign a document called a lease. If it sounds like I am repeating myself, I am. Understanding the legal responsibilities of a lease is very important. A lease is a legal contract between you and the apartment complex/owner. Typically, people sign a 1 year lease. The landlord may have shorter leases that have a higher monthly rent, or a longer lease that has a slightly smaller monthly rent. Either way, it means that you agree to live there for the length of the lease and if you move out early for whatever reason, you still owe rent even if you are not living there until that lease time frame is up. For example, if you sign a 1 year lease for $1000 per month, but you, or your roommate, moves out in the 10th month, you _still _owe rent for the 11th and 12th month ($1000 x 2 months = $2000).

Also, normally they say you get your deposit back when you move out after fulfilling the terms of the lease. Don't count on ever seeing your money back. They will inspect your apartment when you move out and will find an excuse to bill you for anything at all they find wrong until your deposit money is all used up. Sometimes they even add additional fees on top when you move out and you end up owing them even more money. Lesson here:keep the apartment clean and take care of it as if you owned it. A good apartment complex will give you _some _of your money back, but almost never _all _of it.

**Upfront costs**: Approx. $1600 maybe more, maybe less

**Monthly costs**: Approx. $1000
